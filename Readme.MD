# Text2Image

This project is model based on the Pytorch implementation of [AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Xu_AttnGAN_Fine-Grained_Text_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) by Tao Xu, Pengchuan Zhang, Qiuyuan Huang, Han Zhang, Zhe Gan, Xiaolei Huang, Xiaodong He which was done in [this](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN). The training was done training this model on Google Collab to get the text-encoder and the Attention GAN models present in [app/data](https://github.com/rishabhsahlot/Text2Image/tree/master/app/data), which are used for the generation task. This repository additonally provided a Flask App to visualize the results.

This work was done by [Karthik Nair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karthik-nair-93223712a/), [Purvam Pujari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/purvampujari/) and [myself](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabh-sahlot)

Below we show the Front-End Application we have provided:-
